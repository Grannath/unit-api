# Contribution

* Star the project on [Github](https://github.com/raynigon/unit-api) and help spread the word :)
* [Post an issue](https://github.com/raynigon/unit-api/issues) if you find any bugs
* Contribute improvements or fixes using a [Pull Request](https://github.com/raynigon/unit-api/pulls). 
If you're going to contribute, thank you! Please just be sure to:
    * discuss with the authors on an issue ticket prior to doing anything big.
    * follow the style, naming and structure conventions of the rest of the project.
    * make commits atomic and easy to merge.
    * verify all tests are passing. Build the project with `./gradlew check` to do this.
    **N.B.** Gradle's Build Cache is enabled by default, but you can add `--no-build-cache` flag to disable it.
