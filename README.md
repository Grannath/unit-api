# unit-api
![CI](https://github.com/raynigon/unit-api/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Integration of the junit-api into various frameworks (Jackson, Spring Boot, JPA etc.)

The Spring Boot starter modules will allow you to use the unit-api directly in Spring Boot without configuration.
You can also use the Jackson Module for non Spring boot Use cases.
The unit-api allows you to specify SI Units instead of primitives,
which will allow compile time verification for all your Unit attributes.
